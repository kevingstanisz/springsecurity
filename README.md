In this Youtube tutorial bu Amigoscode, we went over the value of Spring Security. Spring Security simplifies a lot of security concepts into an abstracted way and can use the API's to secure the application. 

The three types of security that are covered in this Youtube tutorial are Basic Authentication, Form Based Authentication, and JSON Web Token. 

I would highly recommend this course because it covers the pros and cons of each as well how to efficiently each type of security method.
